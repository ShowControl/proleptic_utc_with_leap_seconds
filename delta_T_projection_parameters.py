# According to the USNO (http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/predcoef.out)
# and the text version of IERS Bulletin A
# (https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Publications/Bulletins/bulletins.html)
# you can predict UT1-UTC with a formula.  The formula changes each week.
# In IERS Bulletin A volume XVIII Number 001, dated January 6, 2005,
# the formula was:
#
#   UT1-UTC = -.5206 - (0.00030 * (MJD - 53381)) - (UT2 - UT1)
#
# UT2-UT1 is computed as: (http://maia.usno.navy.mil and IERS Bulletin A)
#
#   UT2-UT1 = 0.022 * sin(2*pi*T) - 0.012 * cos(2*pi*T)
#                                 - 0.006 * sin(4*pi*T) + 0.007 * cos(4*pi*T)
#
# Where T is the date in Besselian years:
#  2000.000 + ((MDJ - 51544.03) / 365.2422),
# and MJD is the Modified Julian Date,
#  which is the Julian Day Number - 2400000.5.
#
# The parts of this formula that vary from week to week are the three
# numbers in the first formula, which I will call the UT1_offset,
# the UT1_slope and the UT1_base_MJD.  We can then write the first formula
# in terms of these variables as follows:
#
#   UT1-UTC = UT1_offset + (UT1_slope * (MJD - UT1_base_MJD)) - (UT2-UT1)
#
# Each week the IERS publishes new values for the variables.
# Here are some values of the variables from IERS Bulletin A:
