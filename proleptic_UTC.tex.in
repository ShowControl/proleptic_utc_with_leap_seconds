\section{Civil Timekeeping}
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the basis of civil time in the world
today.  Local time is defined as an offset from UTC.  In places which
observe daylight saving time, the offset changes when daylight saving
time begins and ends.

UTC is based on the SI second, which is a fixed interval of time,
independent of the motions of the Earth.  However, for civil purposes
timekeeping has always been based on the days and the seasons.  The
duration of Earth's day is not fixed: it has small
random variations, and is gradually increasing as the rotation of the
Earth slows.  In addition, the year is not an integral number of days
in length.  We use a complex system of timekeeping to reconcile a
fixed time interval with the changing length of the day, and the days
with the seasons. 

\section{The Gregorian Calendar}
To fit days into years we use the Gregorian calendar, which provides 12
months of 28 to 31 days each, for a total of 365 or 366 days in a year.
The 366-day years add a day after February 28 called February 29.
The rule for adding February 29 is that every year evenly divisible
by 4 shall have a February 29, unless the year is also evenly divisible
by 100.  However, if the year is also evenly divisible by 400 it shall
have a February 29.

\section{Matching SI Seconds to the Rotation of the Earth}
To fit the SI second into days, UTC starts a new day every \num{86399},
\num{86400} or \num{86401} seconds.
Most days are ordinary days with \num{86400} seconds.
The last day of a month can be an extraordinary day, with
\num{86399} or \num{86401} seconds.
In an extraordinary day with \num{86399} seconds, the last second
of the day is called 23:59:58.
In an ordinary day with \num{86400} seconds, the last second of the
day is called 23:59:59.
In an extraordinary day with \num{86401} seconds, the last second
of the day is called 23:59:60.

The extraordinary days are scheduled by the International Earth
Rotation and Reference Systems Service
(IERS)\footnote{\href{https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Home/home_node.html}{https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Home/home\_node.html}}
based on observations of the Earth's rotation.  A long day is
used when UTC is counting faster than the Earth is rotating, and a
short day is used when UTC is counting slower than the Earth is
rotating.

\section{A Brief History of Timekeeping}
\label{section:A_Brief_History_of_Timekeeping}
The Gregorian calendar was adopted starting in 1582 because the seasons
had slowly changed their dates under the previous calendar.  The
changeover included dropping 10 days from the calendar to correct the
accumulated error.  Since the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, the
years 1700, 1800 and 1900 have not included February 29, but the years
1600 and 2000 have.

The IERS began scheduling extraordinary days in 1972 so that civil time could
use the SI second rather than a variable\hyp{}length second.
As of the time of this writing, in January of 2025, there have been \num{27}
days with \num{86401} seconds and \num{0} days with \num{86399} seconds.

Before 1972 there was a time scale also called UTC, but which used a
different method of matching SI seconds to the Earth's rotation.
In this paper the term ``UTC'' refers to the UTC used since 1972.

\section{Proleptic Gregorian Calendar}
For some purposes, it is useful to extend the rules of the Gregorian
calendar to dates before 1582.  For example, when describing Mayan
culture for a general audience, the mythical creation date of 13
b\symbol{"02BC}ak\symbol{"02BC}tuns, 0 k\symbol{"02BC}atuns,
0 tuns, 0 winals, 0 kins (4 Ajaw, 8 Kumk\symbol{"02BC}u)
is translated as August 11, 3114 BCE.
Mayan scholars generally translate Mesoamerican Long Count
calendar dates into Proleptic Gregorian dates
rather than the Julian calendar dates used for civil timekeeping in Europe at
the time of the Mayan civilization because, to a modern audience, the
proleptic Gregorian date conveys the season of the year more accurately.

\section{Proleptic UTC}
If we are to specify ancient times with a greater precision than a day,
it will also be useful for some purposes to extend the rules of UTC to
times before 1972.  To do this, we need two things: a time scale and
the rotation rate of the Earth in the past.
\subsection{Time Scale}
For a time scale to be useful for measuring events, it must be based
on some physical property that can be measured.  UTC is based on the
SI second, which is defined as the duration of \num{9192631770} periods of the
radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of
the ground state of the cesium~133 atom when it is at rest with respect to
the Earth, at a temperature of 0~Kelvin, and located at mean sea level.
These measurements are made continuously by national laboratories around the
world.  The data is sent to the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures}
{International Bureau of Weights and Measures}, which combines the information
and disseminates
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time}
     {International Atomic Time}, upon which UTC is based.

A time scale used for scientific measurements must be rigorously defined
and robustly measured, as International Atomic Time is.  If we try to extend
this definition backward into ancient times, we run into the problem that
there were no atomic clocks before 1955, and therefore nobody was measuring
the SI second as it is presently defined.

However, when describing ancient events, we do not need to actually measure
time, we can instead imagine that we are measuring it.  For example, we say
that the Big Bang that marked the start of the Universe took place
\num{13.787}~billion
years ago.  In this context, ``years'' does not refer to the number of times
that the Earth has gone around the Sun since the Big Bang, because the Earth
has only been in existence for the last \num{4.54}~billion years.
Instead, we take the present duration of a year and project it back in time,
thus imagining that we are measuring time using the year as it presently
exists.

Similarly, we can imagine that atomic clocks have been measuring time for
the last \num{4000} years, and use that as our time scale.  This imaginary time
scale does not have the precision of International Atomic Time, since
there were not, in fact, atomic clocks \num{4000} years ago, but it is
sufficient for our limited purpose.
\subsection{Rotation Rate of the Earth}
The Earth revolves around the Sun at a constant rate, so the schedule of
366-day years is predictable.  The Earth's rotation rate, on the other hand,
is unpredictable, and must be observed.  That observation is described
as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%94T_(timekeeping)}{$\Delta$T},
  which is the difference between
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_Time}{Terrestrial Time}%
  \footnote{Terrestrial Time differs from International Atomic Time by
    \num{32.184} seconds.}and UTC.
Using historical records of astronomical
observations, F.~R.~Stephenson, L.~V.~Morrison, C.~Y.~Hohenkerk
and M.~Zawilski have
estimated the values of $\Delta$T from the year \num{-2000} to
\num{2500}\citep{Stephenson20160404}%
\embedfile[desc={Measurement of the Earth's Rotation: 720 BC to AD 2500},
  mimetype={application/PDF},]{@srcdir@/20160404.full.pdf}.
The table below is based on the data calculated in that paper,
presented at \href{http://astro.ukho.gov.uk/nao/lvm/}{http://astro.ukho.gov.uk/nao/lvm/},
as updated in February 2021\citep{Stephenson20210217}%

          {@srcdir@/rspa20200776_si_001.pdf}.
Where the data
presented two different values of $\Delta$T for the same date,
I have averaged the values.  In the table below I have presented
$\Delta$T as seconds, omitted the estimated error, and added a column
showing the Julian Day Number for each date.
The Julian Day Number is the count of days since noon on
November 24, \num{-4713},
so using it to measure time avoids the complexity of the Gregorian calendar.
Because the Julian Day starts at noon, adding \num{0.5} means the midnight
which starts the next day.

          {@builddir@/delta_t.tex}.

\section{Schedule of Extraordinary Days}
Using this information we can schedule extraordinary days as though UTC
were being used prior to 1972.  In 2006 Tony Finch created a proleptic
UTC back to 1958 using US Naval Observatory
tables\footnote{\href{https://fanf.livejournal.com/69586.html}{https://fanf.livejournal.com/69586.html}}
so I will follow his lead for those dates.

To schedule extraordinary days, we establish an anchor point
and march forward through time, observing the deviation of
$\Delta$T from the value at the anchor point.
Before the deviation reaches \num{0.9} seconds, we must designate
an extraordinary day.
If the interval includes a June~30 or December~31,
we will designate that day.  If it does not, the next dates to choose
will be March~31 and September~30, and if they are not available
we will designate the last day of any month.
The procedure is based on the formal definition of
UTC.\footnote{The definition of UTC
  is maintained by the International Telecommunications Union as their document
  ITU-R TF.460-6, which you can see at
  \href{https://www.itu.int/dms\_pubrec/itu-r/rec/tf/R-REC-TF.460-6-200202-I!!PDF-E.pdf}{https://www.itu.int/dms\_pubrec/itu-r/rec/tf/R-REC-TF.460-6-200202-I!!PDF-E.pdf}
  \embedfile[desc={ITR-R TF.460-6},mimetype={application/PDF}]
            {@srcdir@/R-REC-TF.460-6-200202-I!!PDF-E.pdf}
}.  However, if the value of $\Delta$T changes so much that two extraordinary
days are needed in the same month, we designate the
\num{15}{\textsuperscript {th}} and the last day of the month.
Details of this process are in file {\filename read\_delta\_t.py},
which is embedded in this PDF file, as described in section
\ref{section:EmbeddedFiles}.

At the end of each extraordinary day, the difference between UTC and
International Atomic Time changes by one second.  That difference is
called DTAI, and it is defined to be \num{0} at the beginning of
January~1, 1958.

The result of the scheduling process is too large for this paper, but
here are the extraordinary days from 1700 to 2100.
The complete table is embedded in this
PDF under the name {\filename extraordinary\_days.dat},
as described in section \ref{section:EmbeddedFiles}.
Extraordinary days before 1958 are computed based on the estimates of
$\Delta$T, as described above.  From 1958 through 1971 the dates are
from Tony Finch.  From 1972 to the present they are the official days
scheduled by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems
Service
(IERS)\footnote{\href{https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/DataProducts/EarthOrientationData/eop.html}{https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/DataProducts/EarthOrientationData/eop.html}}.
The schedule for the future is based on projections from the IERS
and astronomical projections of $\Delta$T.

Another way of presenting the change in DTAI over time is by a
series of charts.
Figure \ref{figure:DTAI} shows DTAI from the year \num{-2000} to \num{2500},
\ref{figure:DTAI_since_1500} from \num{1500} to \num{2050},
\ref{figure:DTAI_since_1600} from \num{1600} to \num{2050},
\ref{figure:DTAI_since_1700} from \num{1700} to \num{2050},
\ref{figure:DTAI_since_1800} from \num{1800} to \num{2050},
\ref{figure:DTAI_since_1900} from \num{1900} to \num{2050},
\ref{figure:DTAI_since_1950} from \num{1950} to \num{2050} and
\ref{figure:DTAI_since_2000} from \num{2000} to \num{2100}.

The first chart shows only a smooth line.  Subsequent charts focus closer
to the present and so show the randomness in the Earth's rate of rotation
that has been measurable since the invention of the telescope and the
pendulum clock.

\section{POSIX}
POSIX is a portable operating system interface based on Unix, intended
to maintain compatibility between operating systems\footnote{
  \href{https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/}{https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/}}.
The way POSIX represents time has been criticized for not handling UTC
well.\footnote{
 \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16539436/unix-time-and-leap-seconds}{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16539436/unix-time-and-leap-seconds}}%

Markus Kuhn\footnote{\href{https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/time/c/}{https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/time/c/}}
and David Madore\footnote{
  \href{http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/unix-leap-seconds.html}{http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/unix-leap-seconds.html}}
have made proposals to improve the way POSIX deals with extraordinary days.
These proposals require a table of extraordinary days.  Implementations
of these proposals which wish to deal with dates before \num{1972} can
use table \ref{table:JDN_DTAI}.
    
\section{Conclusion}
The exact choice of when to have days with \num{86399} or \num{86401}
seconds in ancient times is somewhat arbitrary, since we don't have
sufficiently accurate records of the Earth's rotation
rate before the invention of the telescope and the pendulum clock.
Indeed, prior to the invention of atomic chronometers in 1955 there
were no practically available clocks which were as stable as the
rotation of the Earth.  Nevertheless, this time scale
can be useful for translating ancient times more precise than days into
modern terminology for the general reader.

I propose to name this time scale ``proleptic UTC with leap seconds''.

  \em Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation: 700 BC--AD 1600}
  \citep{2011ASSP...23....3S}

 Abstract: For the whole of the pre\hyp{}telescopic period, eclipse observations
 have proved to be by far the best data with which to determine changes in the
 Earth's rate of rotation.  These changes -- on the scale of
 milliseconds -- are produced by both the tides and a variety of non\hyp{}tidal
 mechanisms.  Each individual observation leads to a result for $\Delta$T (the
 cumulative effect of changes in the Earth's spin rate). Over a period of many
 centuries, this parameter can attain several hours and thus can be determined
 using fairly crude observations.
 
 Recently I have extended previous investigations by introducing hitherto
 unused observations and reinterpreting some of the more reliable existing
 data: especially in the periods from 700 BC to 50 BC and from AD 300 to 800.
 This has led to the derivation of revised $\Delta$T values over much of the
 historical period.

  \em The length of day since 1656}
  \citep{1986PEPI...44..281M}

  Abstract: Observed values of the difference between the time determined
  using the rotation of the Earth and a uniform time scale are available
  since 1627, with useful observations becoming available in 1656.
  These early data were recorded with low precision and must be smoothed
  numerically in order to be useful for the derivation of estimates of the
  difference between the actual length of the day and the standard 24 h,
  known as excess length of day, or the Earth's rotational speed.
  Modern data requires no smoothing. The observational data have been adjusted
  to be consistent with one estimate of the lunar acceleration and smoothed
  so that the internal and external precision of the observations are
  approximately equal. The final values along with the derived excess length
  of day are presented and their spectra are
  discussed.

  \em Fluctuations in the Earth's rotation since 1830 from high\hyp{}resolution
  astronomical data}
  \citep{Jordi01061994}
  
  Summary: Fluctuations in the Earth's rotation since 1830, as evidenced by
             changes in the length of the day, are derived from astronomical
	     data having subannual resolution. Before 1955.5, timings of lunar
	     occultations are used; after 1955.5, the data are taken from the
	     time series TAI-UT1.

             Although the data in the earliest period,
	     1830–90, display decade fluctuations in the length of the day,
	     they are not accurate enough to reveal interannual variations.
	     In this regard, also, the results from 1890–1925 are somewhat
	     dubious. The quality of the data after 1925, though, is such
	     that the temporal behaviour of the interannual fluctuations in
	     the length of the day can be traced with confidence. We present
	     plots of the interannual fluctuations in the period 1890–1987
	     and the longer\hyp{}term decade fluctuations in the period
             1830–1983.

             The interannual fluctuations in the length of the day since 1925
	     are compared with an index of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation
	     (ENSO) phenomenon in the ocean\hyp{}atmosphere system and are
	     subjected to spectral analysis. The results support the
	     conclusions reached by other authors that these fluctuations are
	     linked to circulation changes in the atmosphere associated with
	     ENSO, and in part to the quasi\hyp{}biennial oscillation in the
	     equatorial stratosphere's zonal winds. A spectral analysis of our
	     62 yr series of length of day values since 1925 reveals two
	     significant peaks in the interannual range 2–4 yr.
	     One is roughly biennial and the other is about twice this period,
	     broadly supporting results obtained previously from shorter
	     records.

             Our analysis of high\hyp{}resolution data, therefore,
	     contributes to ongoing efforts to establish a close relationship
	     between the length of the day and aspects of the global climate
	     system in the period before modern data became available in
	     1955.5.

\item{Dennis D. Mccarthy and Brian J. Luzum,
  \em An Analysis of Tidal Variations in the Length of Day}
  \citep{Mccarthy01081993}

  Summary: Observations of the length of day, corrected for the effects of
  variations in the angular momentum due to changes in wind velocity and
  atmospheric pressure, ocean\hyp{}tide heights and currents,
  and solid\hyp{}Earth
  zonal tides, were analysed. The (1992) IERS Standards model for the effects
  of zonal tides on the Earth's rotation, which includes
  ocean\hyp{}tidal effects,
  adequately accounts for the observations of the high\hyp{}frequency
  (periods between one and 30 days) variations in the length of day at the
  present level of accuracy. A currently unexplained semi\hyp{}annual variation
  in the length of day remains, but this may be due to the unmodelled effects
  of stratospheric winds. The power spectrum of the remaining variations
  with periods less than 20 days is essentially that of a
  white\hyp{}noise process.
  The amplitudes of the remaining unexplained variations in length of day are
  less than 30 microseconds.

  Update file {\filename references.bib} if you modify, add
  or remove any of the literature references.
    
  If you wish to change the algorithm for converting $\Delta$T to
  extraordinary
  days, change {\filename read\_delta\_t.py} to implement your new
  algorithm and run it to create the data lines for file
  {\filename extraordinary\_days.dat}.  See {\filename Makefile.am}
  for details.

  If you wish to update the values of $\Delta$T, for example to take
  advantage of new research, if you have LibreOffice you can update
  {\filename values\_of\_delta\_T.ods} and save a copy as
  {\filename values\_of\_delta\_T.csv}. If you don't have LibreOffice
  you can use a text editor to update file {\filename values\_of\_delta\_T.csv}
  directly.  Then re-run {\filename read\_delta\_t} as above
  and run {\filename reformat\_delta\_t} as follows:

  {\sloppy
  {\filename python3 reformat\_delta\_t.py values\_of\_delta\_T.csv
    delta\_t.tex}}

  {\sloppy
  File {\filename extraordinary\_days.dat} is built from files
  {\filename exdays\_01.dat}, {\filename exdays\_02.dat},
  {\filename exdays\_03.dat}, {\filename exdays\_04.dat} and
  {\filename exdays\_05.dat}
  using the procedure described in {\filename Makefile.am}.
  Note that file {\filename exdays\_01.dat} has the heading comments,
  including the revision date, which you can edit.
  File {\filename Makefile.am} also has the recipes for building
  {\filename gnuplot.dat} and {\filename extra\-ordin\-ary\_\-days.tex}.
