\section{Civil Timekeeping}
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the basis of civil time in the world
today.  Local time is defined as an offset from UTC.  In places which
observe daylight saving time, the offset changes when daylight saving
time begins and ends.

UTC is based on the SI second, which is a fixed interval of time,
independent of the motions of the Earth.  However, for civil purposes
timekeeping has always been based on the days and the seasons.  The
duration of Earth's day is not fixed: it has small
random variations, and is gradually increasing as the rotation of the
Earth slows.  In addition, the year is not an integral number of days
in length.  There is a complex system of timekeeping to reconcile a
fixed time interval with the changing length of the day, and the days
with the seasons. 

\section{The Gregorian Calendar}
To fit days into years we use the Gregorian calendar, which provides 12
months of 28 to 31 days each, for a total of 365 or 366 days in a year.
The 366-day years add a day after February 28 called February 29.
The rule for adding February 29 is that every year evenly divisible
by 4 shall have a February 29, unless the year is also evenly divisible
by 100.  However, if the year is also evenly divisible by 400 it shall
have a February 29.

\section{Matching SI Seconds to the Rotation of the Earth}
To fit the SI second into days, UTC starts a new day every \num{86399},
\num{86400} or \num{86401} seconds.
Most days are ordinary days with \num{86400} seconds.
The last day of a month can be an extraordinary day, with
\num{86399} or \num{86401} seconds.
In an extraordinary day with \num{86399} seconds, the last second
of the day is called 23:59:58.
In an ordinary day with \num{86400} seconds, the last second of the
day is called 23:59:59.
In an extraordinary day with \num{86401} seconds, the last second
of the day is called 23:59:60.

The extraordinary days are scheduled by the International Earth
Rotation and Reference Systems Service
(IERS)\footnote{\url{https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Home/home_node.html}}
based on observation of the Earth's rotation.  A long day is
used when UTC is counting faster than the Earth is rotating, and a
short day is used when UTC is counting slower than the Earth is
rotating.

\section{A Brief History of Timekeeping}
\label{section:A_Brief_History_of_Timekeeping}
The Gregorian calendar was adopted starting in 1582 because the seasons
had slowly changed their dates under the previous calendar.  The
changeover included dropping 10 days from the calendar to correct the
accumulated error.  Since the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, the
years 1700, 1800 and 1900 have not included February 29, but the years
1600 and 2000 have.

The IERS began scheduling extraordinary days in 1972 so that civil time could
use the SI second rather than a variable\hyp{}length second.  At the time of
this writing, in May of 2020, there have been \num{27} days of \num{86401}
seconds and \num{0} days of \num{86399} seconds.

Before 1972 there was a time scale also called UTC, but which used a
different method of matching the Earth's rotation.  In this paper
the term ``UTC'' refers to the UTC used since 1972.

\section{Proleptic Gregorian Calendar}
For some purposes, it is useful to extend the rules of the Gregorian
calendar to dates before 1582.  For example, when describing Mayan
culture for a general audience, the mythical creation date of 13
b'ak'tuns, 0 k'atuns, 0 tuns, 0 winals, 0 kins (4 Ajaw 8
Kumk'u) is translated as August 11, 3114 BCE.  Mayan
scholars generally translate Mayan dates into Proleptic Gregorian
rather than the Julian calendar used for civil timekeeping in Europe at
the time of the Mayan civilization because there was no cultural
contact between the classic Mayans and the people of Europe.

\section{Proleptic UTC}
If we are to specify ancient times with a greater precision than a day,
it will also be useful for some purposes to extend the rules of UTC to
times before 1972.  To do this, we need two things: a time scale and
the rotation rate of the Earth in the past.
\subsection{Time Scale}
For a time scale to be useful for measuring events, it must be based
on some physical property that can be measured.  UTC is based on the
SI second, which is defined as the duration of \num{9192631770} periods of the
radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of
the ground state of the cesium~133 atom when it is at rest with respect to
the Earth, at a temperature of 0~Kelvin, and located at mean sea level.
These measurements are made continuously by national laboratories around the
world.  The data is sent to the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures}
{International Bureau of Weights and Measures}, which combines the information
and disseminates
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time}
     {International Atomic Time}, upon which UTC is based.

A time scale used for scientific measurements must be rigorously defined
and robustly measured, as International Atomic Time is.  If we try to extend
this definition backward into ancient times, we run into the problem that
there were no atomic clocks before 1955, and therefore nobody was measuring
the SI second as it is presently defined.

However, when describing ancient events, we do not need to actually measure
time, we can instead imagine that we are measuring it.  For example, we say
that the Big Bang that marked the start of the Universe took place
\num{13.82}~billion
years ago.  In this context, ``years'' does not refer to the number of times
that the Earth has gone around the Sun since the Big Bang, because the Earth
has only been in existence for the last \num{4.54}~billion years.
Instead, we take the present duration of a year and project it back in time,
thus imagining that we are measuring time using the year as it presently
exists.

Similarly, we can imagine that atomic clocks have been measuring time for
the last \num{4000} years, and use that as our time scale.  This imaginary time
scale does not have the precision of International Atomic Time, since
there were not, in fact, atomic clocks \num{4000} years ago, but it is
sufficient for our limited purpose.
\subsection{Rotation Rate of the Earth}
The Earth revolves around the Sun at a constant rate, so the schedule of
366-day years is predictable.  The Earth's rotation rate, on the other hand,
is unpredictable, and must be observed.  That observation is described
as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%94T}{$\Delta$T}, which is the
  difference between
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_Time}{Terrestrial Time}%
  \footnote{Terrestrial Time differs from International Atomic Time by
    \num{32.184} seconds.}and UTC.
Using historical records of astronomical
observations, F.~R.~Stephenson, L.~V.~Morrison and C.~Y.~Hohenkerk have
estimated the values of $\Delta$T from the year \num{-2000} to
\num{2500}\citep{Stephenson20160404}%
\embedfile[desc={Measurement of the Earth's Rotation: 720 BC to AD 2500},
  mimetype={application/PDF}]{@srcdir@/20160404.full.pdf}.
The table below is based on the data calculated in that paper,
presented at \url{http://astro.ukho.gov.uk/nao/lvm/}, as updated in
September 2018.
Where the data
presented two different values of $\Delta$T for the same date,
I have averaged the values.  In the table below I have presented
$\Delta$T as seconds, omitted the estimated error, and added a column
showing the Julian Day Number for each date.
The Julian Day Number is the count of days since November 24, \num{-4713},
so using it to measure time avoids the complexity of the Gregorian calendar.
The Julian Day starts at noon, so adding \num{0.5} means the midnight
which starts the next day.

\section{Schedule of Extraordinary Days}
Using this information we can schedule extraordinary days as though UTC
were being used prior to 1972.  In 2006 Tony Finch created a proleptic
UTC back to 1958 using US Naval Observatory
tables\footnote{\url{https://fanf.livejournal.com/69586.html}}
so I will follow his lead for those dates.

To schedule extraordinary days, we establish an anchor point
and march forward through time, observing the deviation of
$\Delta$T from the value at the anchor point.
Before the deviation reaches \num{0.9} seconds, we must designate
an extraordinary day.
If the interval includes a June~30 or December~31,
we will designate that day.  If it does not, the next dates to choose
will be March~31 and September~30, and if they are not available
we will designate the last day of any month.
Details of this process are in file {\ttfamily read\_delta\_t.py},
which is embedded in this PDF file, as described in section
\ref{section:EmbeddedFiles}.  The process is based on the formal definition of
UTC.\footnote{The definition of UTC
  is maintained by the International Telecommunications Union as their document
  ITU-R TF.460-6, which you can see at
  \url{https://www.itu.int/dms\_pubrec/itu-r/rec/tf/R-REC-TF.460-6-200202-I!!PDF-E.pdf}
  \embedfile[desc={ITR-R TF.460-6},mimetype={application/PDF}]
            {@srcdir@/R-REC-TF.460-6-200202-I!!PDF-E.pdf}
}

At the end of each extraordinary day, the difference between UTC and
International Atomic Time changes by one second.  That difference is
called DTAI, and it is defined to be \num{0} at the beginning of
January~1, 1958.

The result of the scheduling process is too large for this paper, but
here are the extraordinary days from 1700 to 2100.
The complete table is embedded in this
PDF under the name {\ttfamily extraordinary\_days.dat},
as described in section \ref{section:EmbeddedFiles}.
Extraordinary days before 1958 are computed based on the estimates of
$\Delta$T, as described above.  From 1958 through 1971 the dates are
from Tony Finch.  From 1972 to the present they are the official days
scheduled by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems
Service
(IERS)\footnote{\url{https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/DataProducts/EarthOrientationData/eop.html}}.
The schedule for the future is based on projections from the IERS
and astronomical projections of $\Delta$T.

Another way of presenting the change in DTAI over time is by a
series of charts.
Figure \ref{figure:DTAI} shows DTAI from the year \num{-2000} to \num{2500},
\ref{figure:DTAI_since_1500} from \num{1500} to \num{2050},
\ref{figure:DTAI_since_1600} from \num{1600} to \num{2050},
\ref{figure:DTAI_since_1700} from \num{1700} to \num{2050},
\ref{figure:DTAI_since_1800} from \num{1800} to \num{2050},
\ref{figure:DTAI_since_1900} from \num{1900} to \num{2050},
\ref{figure:DTAI_since_1950} from \num{1950} to \num{2050} and
\ref{figure:DTAI_since_2000} from \num{2000} to \num{2100}.

The first chart shows only a smooth line.  Subsequent charts focus closer
to the present and so show the randomness in the Earth's rate of rotation
that has been measurable since the invention of the telescope and the
pendulum clock.

\section{POSIX}
POSIX is a portable operating system interface based on Unix, intended
to maintain compatibility between operating systems\footnote{
  \url{https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/}}.
The way POSIX represents time has been criticized for not handling UTC
well.\footnote{
 \url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16539436/unix-time-and-leap-seconds}}%
\footnote{
  \url{https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4112566}}
Markus Kuhn\footnote{\url{https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/time/c/}}
and David Madore\footnote{
  \url{http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/unix-leap-seconds.html}}
have made proposals to improve the way POSIX deals with extraordinary days.
These proposals require a table of extraordinary days.  Implementations
of these proposals which wish to deal with dates before \num{1972} can
use table \ref{table:JDN_DTAI}.
    
\section{Conclusion}
The exact choice of when to have days with \num{86399} or \num{86401}
seconds in ancient times is somewhat arbitrary, since we don't have
sufficiently accurate records of the Earth's rotation
rate before the invention of the telescope and the pendulum clock.
Indeed, prior to the invention of atomic chronometers in 1955 there
were no practically available clocks which were as stable as the
rotation of the Earth.  Nevertheless, this time scale
can be useful for translating ancient times more precise than days into
modern terminology for the general reader.

I propose to name this time scale ``proleptic UTC with leap seconds''.

Many good research papers are hidden behind ``paywalls'' and hence are
not accessible to an unaffilited reader of modest means.  Where I have been able

  \em Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation: 700 BC--AD 1600}
  \citep{2011ASSP...23....3S}

 Abstract: For the whole of the pre\hyp{}telescopic period, eclipse observations
 have proved to be by far the best data with which to determine changes in the
 Earth's rate of rotation.  These changes -- on the scale of
 milliseconds -- are produced by both the tides and a variety of non\hyp{}tidal
 mechanisms.  Each individual observation leads to a result for $\Delta$T (the
 cumulative effect of changes in the Earth's spin rate). Over a period of many
 centuries, this parameter can attain several hours and thus can be determined
 using fairly crude observations.
 
 Recently I have extended previous investigations by introducing hitherto
 unused observations and reinterpreting some of the more reliable existing
 data: especially in the periods from 700 BC to 50 BC and from AD 300 to 800.
 This has led to the derivation of revised $\Delta$T values over much of the
 historical period.

  \em The length of day since 1656}
  \citep{1986PEPI...44..281M}

  Abstract: Observed values of the difference between the time determined
  using the rotation of the Earth and a uniform time scale are available
  since 1627, with useful observations becoming available in 1656.
  These early data were recorded with low precision and must be smoothed
  numerically in order to be useful for the derivation of estimates of the
  difference between the actual length of the day and the standard 24 h,
  known as excess length of day, or the Earth's rotational speed.
  Modern data requires no smoothing. The observational data have been adjusted
  to be consistent with one estimate of the lunar acceleration and smoothed
  so that the internal and external precision of the observations are
  approximately equal. The final values along with the derived excess length
  of day are presented and their spectra are
  discussed.

  \em An Analysis of Tidal Variations in the Length of Day}
  \citep{Mccarthy01081993}

  Summary: Observations of the length of day, corrected for the effects of
  variations in the angular momentum due to changes in wind velocity and
  atmospheric pressure, ocean\hyp{}tide heights and currents,
  and solid\hyp{}Earth
  zonal tides, were analysed. The (1992) IERS Standards model for the effects
  of zonal tides on the Earth's rotation, which includes
  ocean\hyp{}tidal effects,
  adequately accounts for the observations of the high\hyp{}frequency
  (periods between one and 30 days) variations in the length of day at the
  present level of accuracy. A currently unexplained semi\hyp{}annual variation
  in the length of day remains, but this may be due to the unmodelled effects
  of stratospheric winds. The power spectrum of the remaining variations
  with periods less than 20 days is essentially that of a
  white\hyp{}noise process.
  The amplitudes of the remaining unexplained variations in length of day are
  less than 30 microseconds.

             changes in the length of the day, are derived from astronomical
	     data having subannual resolution. Before 1955.5, timings of lunar
	     occultations are used; after 1955.5, the data are taken from the
	     time series TAI-UT1.

             Although the data in the earliest period,
	     1830â€“90, display decade fluctuations in the length of the day,
	     they are not accurate enough to reveal interannual variations.
	     In this regard, also, the results from 1890â€“1925 are somewhat
	     dubious. The quality of the data after 1925, though, is such
	     that the temporal behaviour of the interannual fluctuations in
	     the length of the day can be traced with confidence. We present
	     plots of the interannual fluctuations in the period 1890â€“1987
	     and the longer\hyp{}term decade fluctuations in the period
             1830â€“1983.

             The interannual fluctuations in the length of the day since 1925
	     are compared with an index of the El NiÃ±o/Southern Oscillation
	     (ENSO) phenomenon in the ocean\hyp{}atmosphere system and are
	     subjected to spectral analysis. The results support the
	     conclusions reached by other authors that these fluctuations are
	     linked to circulation changes in the atmosphere associated with
	     ENSO, and in part to the quasi\hyp{}biennial oscillation in the
	     equatorial stratosphere's zonal winds. A spectral analysis of our
	     62 yr series of length of day values since 1925 reveals two
	     significant peaks in the interannual range 2â€“4 yr.
	     One is roughly biennial and the other is about twice this period,
	     broadly supporting results obtained previously from shorter
	     records.

             Our analysis of high\hyp{}resolution data, therefore,
	     contributes to ongoing efforts to establish a close relationship
	     between the length of the day and aspects of the global climate
	     system in the period before modern data became available in
	     1955.5.

\section{Embedded Files}
\label{section:EmbeddedFiles}
For the convenience of the reader, there are some files embedded in
the PDF of this paper.  You can extract them using
{\href{https://okular.kde.org/}{okular}}.
You can also try to use Adobe Acrobat Reader, but it may refuse to extract
some attachments.
Except as noted, the embedded files are covered by the same license as
this paper.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Files {\ttfamily 20160404.full.pdf}, which is the main research paper
  on reducing historical records to {$\Delta$T}, and
  {\ttfamily R-REC-TF.460-6-200202-I!!PDF-E.pdf}, the definition
  of UTC.  They are referenced in this paper by name and with a hyperlink.
  The files are embedded in this PDF in case the hyperlinks become
  broken.  I do not assert copyright on these files.
\item A spreadsheet named {\ttfamily values\_of\_delta\_T.ods}
  containing the values of $\Delta$T shown in table \ref{table:delta_t}.
  Also included is the same data in a CSV file.
\item A plain text file, downloaded from the
  Creative Commons web site:
  \url{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode.txt}.
  In this file is the legal code for the license for this paper,
  in case the hyperlink in section \ref{section:Licensing} should fail.
  I do not assert copyright on this file.
\item A plain text file named {\ttfamily extraordinary\_days.dat}
  which lists the extraordinary days
  using the form shown in table \ref{table:JDN_DTAI}.  This file lists all
  of the extraordinary days plotted in figure \ref{figure:DTAI},
  not just the subset in table \ref{table:JDN_DTAI}.
\item A program named
  {\ttfamily read\_extraordinary\_days\_table}
  which reads the
  {\ttfamily extra\-ordinary\_days.dat}
  data file.  This program is provided as an example
  of how to read the data file.  It will optionally write the
  {\LaTeX} code for table \ref{table:JDN_DTAI} and a GNUplot data file
  for the figures.
  This program is licensed under the GPL.
\item A plain text copy of the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 3.
\item The source files for this paper.
  The main file is {\ttfamily proleptic\_UTC.tex}.
  That file reads {\LaTeX} files
  {\ttfamily extraordinary\_days.tex}
  and {\ttfamily delta\_t.tex},
  the {\ttfamily .pdf} files for the figures and
  {\ttfamily proleptic\_UTC.bbl} directly, and copies all the embedded files
  to the output file, {\ttfamily proleptic\_UTC.pdf}.
  You can use these files if you
  wish to publish a derivative of this paper, perhaps with errors
  corrected and your own ideas added.
  To reproduce this PDF, extract all the files and run
  lualatex on {\ttfamily proleptic\_UTC.tex}.  You will have
  to run it more than once to get the forward references to resolve.
\item Also included are files to automate the creation of 
  file {\ttfamily extraordinary\_days.dat} and this paper when the
  IERS updates its information about the Earth's rotation.
  This is also convenient if you modify the paper as described above.
  The IERS publishes new information on Thursday, so to keep
  up with its latest information, do the following late on Thursday:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item After extracting the files, type {\ttfamily bash fix\_files.sh}
    to get the modes of the files set correctly, since they are lost
    when embedded in the PDF.
  \item Edit the revision dates in files
    {\ttfamily proleptic\_UTC.tex.in}, {\ttfamily configure.ac},
    {\ttfamily exdays\_01.dat} and {\ttfamily references.bib}.
  \item Update the ``time of this writing'' phrase in
    secton {\ref{section:A_Brief_History_of_Timekeeping}}
    if the previous update was in an earlier month.
  \item Update the revision history in file {\ttfamily NEWS}.
  \item Update file {\ttfamily proleptic\_utc\_with\_leap\_seconds.spec}
    to show the revision date as the version number, and add to
    the change log.
  \item Type {\ttfamily ./autogen.sh {-}{-}download} to re-create
    file {\ttfamily configure} from file {\ttfamily configure.ac}
    and file {\ttfamily Makefile.in} from file {\ttfamily Makefile.am}.
  \item Type {\ttfamily ./configure {-}{-}prefix=/usr} to re-create
    several files,
    including file {\ttfamily Makefile}, from their {\ttfamily .in} templates.
  \item Type {\ttfamily make download} to download the latest
    Earth rotation information from the IERS.
    Bulletin C, which announces leap seconds, is updated every six months.
    Bulletin A, which lists the time it took for the Earth to rotate each day,
    is updated every week.
  \item \label{step:make} Type {\ttfamily make} to create file
    {\ttfamily extraordinary\_days.dat}.
  \item Type {\ttfamily make pdf} to create file
    {\ttfamily proleptic\_UTC.pdf}.
  \item Type {\ttfamily rm *.gz} to delete the old source tarball.
  \item Type {\ttfamily make dist} to create a new source tarball.
  \item Type {\ttfamily rm *.rpm} to delete the old source RPM file.
  \item Type {\ttfamily make RPMs} to create a new source RPM file.
    See the comments in file {\ttfamily build\_RPM.sh} for details.
  \item Type {\ttfamily make distcheck} to validate the source tarball.
  \item Type {\ttfamily sudo make install} to copy file
    {\ttfamily extraordinary\_days.dat} to directory
    {\ttfamily /usr/share/proleptic\_utc\_with\_leap\_seconds/data}
    so other programs can find it.
  \item If file {\ttfamily extraordinary\_days.dat} has changed:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Rebuild everything that depends on it, so those programs can
        be apprised of the new leap second schedule.
      \item Update files 
        {\ttfamily proleptic\_utc\_with\_leap\_seconds.spec}
        and {\ttfamily NEWS} to describe
        the changes in file {\ttfamily extraordinary\_days.dat}.
      \item Create a new source tarball using this procedure
        by starting at step {\ref{step:make}}.
        File {\ttfamily extraordinary\_days.dat} will not change again.
    \end{enumerate}
    If file {\ttfamily extraordinary\_days.dat} has not changed,
    there is little need to publish the updated PDF.  The only changes
    will be in the embedded files which were downloaded from the IERS.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  You will need Autotools, Python, {\LaTeX} and GNUplot.
  Details of the dependencies are in file
  {\ttfamily proleptic\_utc\_with\_leap\_seconds.spec}.

  Update file {\ttfamily references.bib} if you modify, add
  or remove any of the literature references,
    
  If you wish to change the algorithm for converting $\Delta$T to
  extraordinary
  days, change {\ttfamily read\_delta\_t.py} to implement your new
  algorithm and run it to create the data lines for file
  {\ttfamily extraordinary\_days.dat}.  The exact command line is in
  file {\ttfamily Makefile.am}.

  If you wish to update the values of $\Delta$T, for example to take
  advantage of new research, if you have LibreOffice you can update
  {\ttfamily values\_of\_delta\_T.ods} and save a copy as
  {\ttfamily values\_of\_delta\_T.csv}. If you don't have LibreOffice
  you can use a text editor to update file {\ttfamily values\_of\_delta\_T.csv}
  directly.  Then re-run {\ttfamily read\_delta\_t} as above
  and run {\ttfamily reformat\_delta\_t} as follows:

  {\ttfamily python3 reformat\_delta\_t.py values\_of\_delta\_T.csv
    delta\_t.tex}
  
  Use a text editor to edit the comments for file
  {\ttfamily extraordinary\_days.dat} in file {\ttfamily exdays\_01.dat}.
  See file {\ttfamily Makefile.am} for the mechanics of recreating file
  {\ttfamily extraordinary\_days.dat}, and for creating files
  {\ttfamily gnuplot.dat} and {\ttfamily extraordinary\_days.tex}
  from it.

  To update the figures after changing the schedule of extraordinary days
  you will need GNUplot.  All of the files needed are embedded in this PDF.
  See file {\ttfamily Makefile.am} for details.
