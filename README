# proleptic_utc_with_leap_seconds
Schedule leap seconds for the past and future using today's definition of UTC.

To get the current schedule of leap seconds, download the tarball,
expand it with tar, and do the usual ./configure, make, sudo make install.
The file extraordinary_days.dat, which lists the leap seconds,
will be installed on /usr/local/share/proleptic_utc_with_leap_seconds/data/
You can instead install it on /usr/share/ by typing ./configure --prefix=/usr.

If you download the tarball from the git repository, you can also download
its signature file, which has the same name as the tarball with .asc appended.
I created the signature file using gpg version 2.  To verify that the tarball
was created by me you will need my public key.  You can get my PGP public key
from a keyserver, from my web site using the WSD protocol by typing
gpg --locate-external-keys John_Sauter@systemeyescomputerstore.com
or by extracting file John_Sauter_public_key.asc from the tarball
and importing it into gpg.  That last process is not too secure, since
if the tarball is compromised the public key file could also be compromised.
Thus, to improve its security, here is what you should see when you list
the public key file:

This should not change between versions without a good reason, so you
can examine a copy of this README file from an old tarball to increase
your confidence that the latest tarball was also created by me.

If you want to maintain the package yourself, or fork it, you can update
the list of leap seconds based on the latest information from the IERS
by typing make download after ./configure.  You shoud also update the
other files as described in the PDF.  The autoconfigure targets check
and distcheck are implemented.  To create the PDF, type make PDF.

If you wish to distribute your updated package, you can create your own
signature file by typing make signature after make distcheck.  In that
case you should update this README file to include your own pgp public
key, and place it in the tarball.
