# proleptic_utc_with_leap_seconds
Schedule leap seconds for the past and future using today's definition of UTC 

Provide the file proleptic_utc_with_leap_seconds.txt which lists all of
the days with leap seconds.  See the comments in the file for details.


If you download the tarball from the git repository, you can also download
its signature file, which has the same name as the tarball with .asc appended.
I created the signature file using gpg version 2.  To verify that the tarball
was created by me you will need my public key.  You can get my PGP public key
from a keyserver, from my web site using the WSD protocol by typing
gpg --locate-external-keys John_Sauter@systemeyescomputerstore.com
or by extracting file John_Sauter_public_key.asc from the tarball
and importing it into gpg.  That last process is not too secure, since
if the tarball is compromised the public key could also be compromised.
Thus, to improve its security, here is what you should see when you list
the public key file:

This should not change between versions without a good reason, so you
can examine a copy of this README file from an old tarball to increase
your confidence that the latest tarball was also created by me.
