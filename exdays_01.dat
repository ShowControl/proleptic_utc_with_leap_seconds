# A program that wishes to measure the time between two dates needs to know
# the length of each day.  Most days are ordinary days, of 86,400 seconds,
# but a few have 86,399 or 86,401 seconds, to keep clocks synchronized with
# the rotation of the Earth.  For dates since 1972, the IERS maintains a
# list of extraordinary days.  For earlier dates, we must imagine that
# current timekeeping rules were in effect and project a list of extraordinary
# days.  See "Extending Coordinated Universal Time to Dates Before 1972."
#
# This table of extraordinary days can be read by any program that needs
# the information.  It uses a simple format with three kinds of lines:
# (1) empty lines, like this one.  Note that any line can end with a comment,
# which starts with "#".  (2) symbol=value lines, which assign a value to
# a symbol.  Certain symbols have meaning, as described below.  (3) data lines,
# formatted as three numbers: the Julian Day Number of the extraordinary day,
# the length of that day in seconds, and the value of DTAI at the end of that
# day.  Data lines must be ascending: earlier dates must come before later ones.
#
# The Julian Day Number is a simple count of days, starting on
# November 24, -4713.  This file contains only the integer part of the
# Julian Day number: to get a proper Julian Day Number add 0.5.  If you
# prefer to use Modified Julian Days (MJD) subtract 2400000.
#
# DTAI is the difference between International Atomic
# Time (TAI) and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  That difference is 0
# on January 1, 1958.  Every extraordinary day changes the value of DTAI
# at its end by +1 second for days with 86,401 seconds, or -1 second for
# days with 86,399 seconds.  Since the data lines must be ordered,
# each will have a DTAI that differs from the preceeding and succeeding line
# by plus or minus 1.
#
# The symbols used in this file are as follows:
#
# START_DATE the Julian Day Number of the beginning of the data.  There may
# be extraordinary days before this date, but they are not recorded in this
# file.  An attempt to determine the time between two dates, either of which
# is before the START_DATE, is likely to be inaccurate.
#
# END_DATE is the Julian Day Number of the end of the data.  There may be
# extraordinary days after this date, but they are not recorded in this file.
# An attempt to determine the time between two dates, either of which is
# after the END_DATE, is likely to be inaccurate.
#
# EXPIRATION_DATE is the Julian Day Number after which this file should have
# been updated.  If you find yourself using this file after its EXPIRATION_DATE,
# look for an updated version of the file.  If necessary you can update it
# yourself, using IERS Bulletin C.  Extraordinary days after the expiration date
# are projections, and are subject to change in later revisions of this file.
#
# CHECKSUM is 64 hex digits of the SHA256 hash of this file, excluding the
# CHECKSUM line.  The sample reading software verifies the checksum, to
# defend against accidental corruption.  It also displays the correct checksum
# in case you are updating the file yourself.
#
START_DATE=990574       # 1 Jan -2000
END_DATE=2634166        # 1 Jan 2500
