This is a test document that illustrates how to incorporate
BibTeX entries generated by the
\href{http://ads.harvard.edu}{NASA Astrophysics Data System}
into \LaTeX\ documents.  The hyperlinking of references is
supported if you use appropriate packages (such as 
hyperref and pdflatex), freely available from
\href{http://www.ctan.org}{The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network}.

Here is a reference to an Annual Review article 
for which we want to create a hyperlink
\citet{1974ARA&A..12..279Z}.

Here is a reference to another article \citet{2000A&AS..143...85A}
with an online URL but whose
bibtex entry has not been generated by ADS (and therefore does not
contain the ``adsnote'' field).

Finally, here is a reference \citet{2000A&AS..143...61E}
without a url, so no link should be created.

This document should be processed using the following commands:

\begin{verbatim}
pdflatex astroads_ex
bibtex astroads_ex
pdflatex astroads_ex
pdflatex astroads_ex
\end{verbatim}

This will generate the PDF file astroads\_ex.pdf containing links
to online documents for those bibliographic entries which have a
URL entry.  Links to bibliographic entries generated by ADS will
be properly identified and the label ``ADS'' (rather than the generic
``LINK'') will be displayed.

If you don't have ``pdflatex'' installed, you can use plain old 
``latex'' but may miss on the hyperlinks.
